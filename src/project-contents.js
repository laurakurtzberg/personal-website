    found that bird species responded in an interesting way to changing environmental conditions.
    Some species are in grave danger after having their habitat destroyed, but others actually
    benefitted from the changes and were growing in popoulation size. The visualization cards
    served to tell this nuanced story and allow listeners to hear the birdsongs of the studied
    species.`,
