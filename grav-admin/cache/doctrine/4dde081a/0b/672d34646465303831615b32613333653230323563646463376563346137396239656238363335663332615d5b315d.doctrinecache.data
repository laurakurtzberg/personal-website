<p>Hi, I'm an <strong>information designer</strong> and <strong>cartographer</strong>. I make interactive maps, data visualizations, and web applications
for news and storytelling. I often work closely with journalists and scientists to create stories with an environmental
focus. My work has been published on <a href="https://ambiental.media/en/15627-2/">Ambiental Media</a>, <a href="https://infoamazonia.org/">InfoAmazonia</a>, and <a href="https://www.mongabay.com/">Mongabay</a>.</p>
