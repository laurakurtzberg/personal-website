<p>Welcome to my personal landing page! My name is Laura Kurtzberg, and lately I've been interested in defining what I do. I've settled on "digital cartographer" to explain that I make maps for the internet. I'm often looking to tell a story when I work on a mapping project, and I work closely with journalists and science communicators. I also do a lot of other things, like data visualization design, news app development, and teaching at Florida International University's School of Journalism &amp; Communication.</p>";s:12:"content_meta";N;}
