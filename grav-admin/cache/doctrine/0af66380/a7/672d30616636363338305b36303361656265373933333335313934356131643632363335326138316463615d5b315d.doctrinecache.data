a:2:{s:7:"content";s:1149:"<p>I made these interactive cards using D3.js as part of the <a href="/aves/florestasilenciosa.ambiental.media/pb">Silent Forest</a> story by Ambiental Media. This story came out after a research paper published in Nature demonstrated the importance of degradation, and not just deforestation, for the biodiversity of the Amazon.</p>
<p>That paper was titled <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v535/n7610/abs/nature18326.html">"Anthropogenic disturbance in tropical forests can double biodiversity loss from deforestation"</a>, and it included an analysis of the impact of degradation on various species, also called "sensitivity to disturbance". </p>
<p>For the "Aves" cards, I focused on birds, specifically. The line charts plot the odds of detection of that particular bird species by the percentage of the forest cover that is degraded. Values near 0 indicate resistance to change, which values near -1 or +1 indicate larger odds of being detected at an extreme. An illustation of the bird and a recording of its birdsong is included on each card.  </p>
