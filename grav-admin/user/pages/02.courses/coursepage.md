Laura Kurtzberg
===============

Hi, I'm an **information designer** and **cartographer**. I make interactive maps, data visualizations, and web applications
for news and storytelling. I often work closely with journalists and scientists to create stories with an environmental
focus. My work has been published on [Ambiental Media](https://ambiental.media/en/15627-2/), [InfoAmazonia](https://infoamazonia.org/), and [Mongabay](https://www.mongabay.com/).

I am also a Professor of Practice at Florida International University's [School of Journalism & Media](https://carta.fiu.edu/journalism/) in Miami, FL,
where I teach courses on data visualization and technology.
