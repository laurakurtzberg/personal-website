===============

Hi, I'm an **information designer** and **cartographer**. I make interactive maps, data visualizations, and web applications
for news and storytelling. I often work closely with journalists and scientists to create stories with an environmental
focus. My work has been published on Ambiental Media, InfoAmazonia, and Mongabay.

I am also a Professor of Practice at Florida International University's School of Journalism & Communication,
where I teach courses on data visualization and technology.
